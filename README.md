# ReaDash
Repo for my CS 6440 Final Practicum Project Deliverables.

ReaDash is an interactive dashboard displaying information relating to diabetes patient hospital readmissions. The user can visualize plots related to features predictive of hospital readmission, interact with a machine learning model (logistic regression) in order to download predictions for their own dataset, and visualize the performance of various machine learning models in predicting hospital readmission for patients with diabetes.
